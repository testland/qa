# nuclei-dast

## Overview

Per [docs.projectdiscovery.io/tools/nuclei/overview][nuclei-overview]:

> "Nuclei is a fast and customisable vulnerability scanner powered by simple
> YAML-based templates."

[nuclei-overview]: https://docs.projectdiscovery.io/tools/nuclei/overview

Each template is a YAML file that defines the request to send plus matchers that
decide whether the response constitutes a finding. The community template library
ships 6,500+ templates covering CVEs, misconfigurations, exposed panels, and
default credentials. Custom templates add app-specific checks without modifying
the tool itself.

Nuclei complements ZAP: ZAP's spider + passive analysis gives broad HTTP
coverage; Nuclei's template corpus gives deep, targeted CVE and misconfiguration
coverage from a structured community library. Both outputs feed a
unified cross-tool triage.

## When to use

- The repo needs CVE-specific or misconfiguration checks beyond ZAP passive scan.
- A CI pipeline should gate on `critical`/`high` template matches without active
  spider coverage.
- The team maintains custom YAML templates for proprietary endpoints.
- Nuclei output must be unified with ZAP findings via cross-tool aggregation.

## Step 1 - Install

Per [docs.projectdiscovery.io/tools/nuclei/install][nuclei-install]:

[nuclei-install]: https://docs.projectdiscovery.io/tools/nuclei/install

**Go (recommended for CI):**

```bash
go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/v3/cmd/nuclei@latest
```

Requires the latest Go toolchain version.

**Homebrew (macOS/Linux):**

```bash
brew install nuclei
```

**Docker:**

```bash
docker pull projectdiscovery/nuclei:latest
```

**Precompiled binary:** download from
[github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/releases](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/releases)
and place on `PATH`.

After install, update the default template library:

```bash
nuclei -update-templates
```

## Step 2 - First scan

Per [docs.projectdiscovery.io/tools/nuclei/running][nuclei-running]:

[nuclei-running]: https://docs.projectdiscovery.io/tools/nuclei/running

```bash
nuclei -u https://staging.example.com -j -o nuclei-report.jsonl
```

`-j` writes JSONL output; `-o` names the file. Each line is one finding, ready
for cross-tool aggregation. The default template set is applied; DOS-capable
templates are excluded from the default run (see Step 6).

## Step 3 - Common flags

Per [nuclei-running][nuclei-running]:

| Flag | Default | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `-u <url>` | (required) | Single target URL or host |
| `-l <file>` | - | File of targets, one per line |
| `-t <path>` | community templates | Template file or directory |
| `-tags <tag,...>` | - | Run only templates with matching tags |
| `-severity <level,...>` | - | Filter by `info`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical` |
| `-etags <tag,...>` | - | Exclude templates by tag |
| `-exclude-severity <level,...>` | - | Skip severity levels |
| `-rl <int>` | 150 | Max requests per second |
| `-c <int>` | 25 | Parallel templates to execute |
| `-bs <int>` | 25 | Hosts processed per template |
| `-timeout <int>` | 10 | Request timeout in seconds |
| `-retries <int>` | 1 | Retries on failure |
| `-j` / `-jsonl` | off | JSONL output (feeds triager) |
| `-o <file>` | stdout | Output file path |
| `-se <file>` | - | SARIF export (GitHub Code Scanning) |
| `-stats` | off | Show live scan statistics |
| `-validate` | off | Syntax-check templates without running |
| `-debug` | off | Print all requests and responses |

Per [nuclei-running][nuclei-running], `-rl` takes precedence over `-c` and `-bs`:
the request rate cannot exceed the value set by `-rl` regardless of concurrency
settings.

## Step 4 - Severity filtering and CI gating

Run only `high` and `critical` templates for a fast CI gate:

```bash
nuclei -u https://staging.example.com \
  -severity high,critical \
  -rl 50 \
  -j -o nuclei-critical.jsonl
```

Then count findings and gate:

```bash
count=$(wc -l < nuclei-critical.jsonl)
if [ "$count" -gt 0 ]; then
  echo "FAIL: $count critical/high findings" >&2
  exit 1
fi
```

For a softer gate (fail on `critical` only, warn on `high`):

```bash
nuclei -u https://staging.example.com -severity critical -j -o nuclei-crit.jsonl
nuclei -u https://staging.example.com -severity high    -j -o nuclei-high.jsonl
```

Run both, fail CI on any line in `nuclei-crit.jsonl`, log `nuclei-high.jsonl`
as advisory.

## Step 5 - Template selection

Per [docs.projectdiscovery.io/templates/introduction][template-intro] and
[docs.projectdiscovery.io/templates/structure][template-struct]:

[template-intro]: https://docs.projectdiscovery.io/templates/introduction
[template-struct]: https://docs.projectdiscovery.io/templates/structure

Community templates are organized by tag. Common tags include `cve`, `rce`,
`sqli`, `xss`, `misconfig`, `exposure`, `default-login`.

Run all CVE templates:

```bash
nuclei -u https://staging.example.com -tags cve -j -o nuclei-cves.jsonl
```

Run a specific template file:

```bash
nuclei -u https://staging.example.com -t nuclei-templates/cves/2024/CVE-2024-1234.yaml
```

Run all templates in a local directory:

```bash
nuclei -u https://staging.example.com -t ./custom-templates/ -j -o nuclei-custom.jsonl
```

List templates that would run without executing:

```bash
nuclei -tl -tags misconfig -severity high,critical
```

## Step 6 - Custom YAML templates

Per [template-struct][template-struct], every template requires: a unique `id`,
an `info` block, and at least one protocol request with matchers.

Minimal HTTP template:

```yaml
id: custom-debug-endpoint

info:
  name: Debug Endpoint Exposed
  author: your-team
  severity: high
  description: "Detects an exposed /debug endpoint returning sensitive runtime info."
  tags: exposure,custom

http:
  - method: GET
    path:
      - "{{BaseURL}}/debug"
    matchers-condition: and
    matchers:
      - type: status
        status:
          - 200
      - type: word
        words:
          - "goroutine"
          - "heap"
        condition: or
```

Matcher types per [template-intro][template-intro]:

| Type | Matches against |
|---|---|
| `word` | Response body or headers contain literal string(s) |
| `regex` | Response body matches a regular expression |
| `status` | HTTP response status code |
| `dsl` | Boolean expression using Nuclei DSL functions |

Validate before running:

```bash
nuclei -t ./custom-templates/custom-debug-endpoint.yaml -validate
```

## Step 7 - JSONL output for cross-tool triage

Each JSONL line represents one match. Key fields:

```json
{
  "template-id": "cve-2024-1234",
  "info": { "name": "...", "severity": "high", "tags": ["cve"] },
  "host": "https://staging.example.com",
  "matched-at": "https://staging.example.com/vulnerable-path",
  "timestamp": "2026-06-04T12:00:00Z"
}
```

Feed the JSONL to cross-tool aggregation:

```bash
nuclei -u https://staging.example.com -j -o nuclei-report.jsonl
# aggregate nuclei-report.jsonl alongside zap-report.json
```

For SARIF output (GitHub Code Scanning):

```bash
nuclei -u https://staging.example.com -se nuclei.sarif
```

## Step 8 - Rate limiting and responsible use

Per [nuclei-running][nuclei-running], the default rate is 150 req/s. Nuclei
generates several thousand requests when the full template set runs against a
single target. Per the [Nuclei FAQ][nuclei-faq]:

[nuclei-faq]: https://docs.projectdiscovery.io/tools/nuclei/faq

> "After detecting a security issue we always recommend that you validate it a
> second time before reporting it." Use `-debug` to confirm the matcher fired
> against the expected response content.

DOS-capable templates are tagged and excluded from default scans. To run them
explicitly (staging only, never production):

```bash
nuclei -u https://staging.example.com -tags dos -rl 5
```

Default-safe limits for shared infrastructure:

```bash
nuclei -u https://staging.example.com -rl 30 -c 10 -bs 10
```

**Only scan targets you are authorized to test.** Nuclei is an active probe
tool; running it against a target without authorization may violate computer
abuse laws.

## Step 9 - CI integration

GitHub Actions:

```yaml
jobs:
  nuclei-dast:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v5

      - name: Install Nuclei
        run: go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/v3/cmd/nuclei@latest

      - name: Update templates
        run: nuclei -update-templates

      - name: Run Nuclei scan
        run: |
          nuclei \
            -u ${{ vars.STAGING_URL }} \
            -severity high,critical \
            -rl 50 \
            -j -o nuclei-report.jsonl

      - name: Gate on findings
        run: |
          count=$(wc -l < nuclei-report.jsonl 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
          echo "Nuclei findings: $count"
          [ "$count" -eq 0 ]

      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        if: always()
        with:
          name: nuclei-report
          path: nuclei-report.jsonl
```

Use `-se nuclei.sarif` and the `github/codeql-action/upload-sarif` action to
surface findings inline in pull request diffs.

## Anti-patterns

| Anti-pattern | Why it fails | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Run all templates against production | Active probes may trigger WAF blocks, corrupt data, or run DOS-tagged templates | Staging only; use `-etags dos` on shared envs |
| Skip `-j` / `-jsonl` output | Findings are stdout-only; can't feed the finding-triage step | Always pass `-j -o <file>` (Step 7) |
| Skip `-rl` in CI on shared infra | Default 150 req/s spikes load on shared staging | Set `-rl 30` or lower (Step 8) |
| Run `-validate` only, skip a real scan | Syntax passes but matchers may produce no output | Always run a real scan against a known-vulnerable target to confirm match |
| Suppress findings without a tracked justification | Invisible risk debt | Use an IGNORE list with date + ticket, same pattern as ZAP config TSV (see [`zap-baseline`](../zap-baseline/SKILL.md) Step 6) |
| Treat `info` severity as noise | `info` templates surface exposed panels, paths, and tech stack - useful for reconnaissance hardening | Route `info` findings to finding triage, not direct suppression |

## Limitations

- Nuclei is active: every template sends at least one HTTP request. It is not
  safe to run the full template set against production.
- Template coverage is only as current as the last `nuclei -update-templates`;
  pin template versions in CI to avoid scan variance between runs.
- Matchers are per-template; a misconfigured custom template silently returns
  no findings. Always `-validate` and smoke-test against a known-vulnerable
  endpoint before trusting zero-finding output.
- Nuclei does not spider the target; it probes specific paths defined in
  templates. Use alongside ZAP for crawl-based coverage.
- `-rl` controls outbound rate but not the total request count; large template
  sets against a slow target may run for tens of minutes.
