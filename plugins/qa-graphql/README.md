# qa-graphql

GraphQL server testing: introspection attack-surface reference, persisted-query strategy, per-framework testing (Apollo Server, GraphQL Yoga, Hasura, Mercurius, Pothos), and an N+1 query detector. Distinct from qa-contract-testing/graphql-schema-regression (contract drift detection); this plugin covers server/runtime + framework-specific patterns.
