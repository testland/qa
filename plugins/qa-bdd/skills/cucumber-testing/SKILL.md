name: cucumber-testing
description: "Configures Cucumber for BDD scenarios - Cucumber-JVM (Java/Kotlin via JUnit 5), Cucumber-JS (Node), Cucumber-Ruby. Authors `.feature` files in Gherkin, writes step definitions in the host language, runs via the framework's runner, integrates with JUnit XML reporting. Use when the user mentions Cucumber, Gherkin, `.feature` files, or behavior-driven (BDD) tests in Java, Kotlin, JavaScript, or Ruby, as the canonical wrapper for any of the three official implementations."

# cucumber-testing

## Overview

Per [cucumber-install][ci]:

[ci]: https://cucumber.io/docs/installation/

> "Cucumber is available for most mainstream programming
> languages."

Cucumber implementations split into tiers ([cucumber-install][ci]):

> - **Official**: Hosted under the main Cucumber organization
>   (JavaScript, Java, Ruby, Android, Kotlin, Scala, C++)
> - **Semi-official**: Developed elsewhere but use Cucumber
>   components (PHP's Behat, Python's Behave, .NET's Reqnroll)

This skill covers the three most-used official implementations:
**Cucumber-JVM** (Java + Kotlin), **Cucumber-JS** (Node), and
**Cucumber-Ruby**. For Python, see
`behave-testing`. For .NET, see
`reqnroll-testing`.

## When to use

- The team uses BDD with Gherkin features.
- Cross-stakeholder collaboration is the value (Gherkin scenarios
  read by non-engineers).
- Acceptance criteria authored as Gherkin scenarios per
  `acceptance-criteria-extractor` (in the qa-shift-left plugin).

If only engineers will read the tests, BDD's collaboration value
is wasted - plain xUnit-style tests are simpler.

## Step 1 - Install (Cucumber-JVM)

Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>
  <artifactId>cucumber-java</artifactId>
  <version>7.20.0</version>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>
  <artifactId>cucumber-junit-platform-engine</artifactId>
  <version>7.20.0</version>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

For Kotlin: replace `cucumber-java` with `cucumber-kotlin`.

## Step 2 - Install (Cucumber-JS)

```bash
npm install --save-dev @cucumber/cucumber
```

## Step 3 - Install (Cucumber-Ruby)

```bash
gem install cucumber
# Or in Gemfile:
group :test do
  gem 'cucumber-ruby'
end
```

## Step 4 - Author a Feature

```gherkin
# features/cart.feature
Feature: Apply promo code at checkout

  Background:
    Given a logged-in user with email confirmed
    And the cart contains 1 of "BOOK-001" at $24.99

  Scenario: Apply valid promo
    When I enter "WELCOME10" in the promo input
    And I click "Apply"
    Then the subtotal updates to $22.49
    And a confirmation toast appears

  Scenario Outline: Promo validation rejects bad codes
    When I enter "<code>" in the promo input
    And I click "Apply"
    Then an error appears: "<error>"

    Examples:
      | code         | error                    |
      | EXPIRED50    | This code has expired    |
      | NOTREAL      | Code not found           |
      | "" (empty)   | Please enter a code      |
```

## Step 5 - Write step definitions

Bind each Gherkin line to a method with a `{cucumber-expression}` capture.
Minimal JS example:

```javascript
const { Given, When, Then } = require('@cucumber/cucumber');

Given('a logged-in user with email confirmed', function() {
  this.page = new CheckoutPage(createLoggedInUser());
});

When('I enter {string} in the promo input', function(code) {
  this.page.enterPromo(code);
});

Then('the subtotal updates to ${float}', function(expected) {
  assert.equal(this.page.getSubtotal(), expected);
});
```

Full Java (Cucumber-JVM) and JS step definitions, plus the JUnit XML reporting
config, are in
[references/step-definitions-and-reporting.md](references/step-definitions-and-reporting.md).

## Step 6 - Run

JVM (via Maven):

```bash
mvn test
# Or specific feature:
mvn test -Dcucumber.features=features/cart.feature
```

JS:

```bash
npx cucumber-js features/
```

Ruby:

```bash
cucumber features/
```

## Step 7 - Reporting

Cucumber outputs multiple formats; JUnit XML is the CI-canonical one and feeds
`junit-xml-analysis` (in the qa-test-reporting plugin). The JVM
(`cucumber.properties`) and JS (CLI) reporting config is in
[references/step-definitions-and-reporting.md](references/step-definitions-and-reporting.md).

## Step 8 - Tags + filtering

```gherkin
@regression @critical
Scenario: Apply valid promo
  ...
```

```bash
# Run only critical tests
npx cucumber-js features/ --tags '@critical'

# Skip @wip
npx cucumber-js features/ --tags 'not @wip'
```

## Anti-patterns

| Anti-pattern                                                          | Why it fails                                                              | Fix |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----|
| Imperative steps ("I click button id=#submit")                        | Couples to implementation; scenarios become fragile.                     | Declarative steps ("I submit the form"). |
| 100 unique step definitions                                            | Drift; inconsistency.                                                     | Step library curation (see `bdd-step-library-curator`). |
| BDD without business stakeholder involvement                            | Defeats the point; expensive xUnit tests.                                | If non-engineers don't read the features, switch to plain unit tests. |
| Mixing Cucumber + plain JUnit assertions                                | Two test runners; double maintenance.                                    | Cucumber's runner only; plain JUnit for non-BDD tests in separate suite. |
| Skipping `Background` for shared setup                                  | Repeated Given lines clutter scenarios.                                  | Background block (Step 4 example). |

## Limitations

- **Step ambiguity.** Two step definitions matching the same
  Gherkin line cause runtime errors; the framework reports
  ambiguous steps but only at runtime.
- **Per-language quirks.** Cucumber-JVM's regex syntax differs
  from Cucumber-JS's; copy-paste between languages doesn't work.
- **Performance.** BDD adds runner overhead vs plain xUnit;
  acceptable for <500-test suites, slow beyond.
- **Step-definition discoverability.** Without IDE plugin, finding
  the implementation behind a Gherkin line is manual grep.
