# lighthouse-perf

## Overview

The **Core Web Vitals** are Google's three canonical user-experience
metrics ([web-vitals][webvitals]):

[webvitals]: https://web.dev/articles/vitals

| Metric | Measures              | "Good" threshold        |
|--------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| **LCP** (Largest Contentful Paint) | Loading performance    | ≤ **2.5 seconds**           |
| **INP** (Interaction to Next Paint) | Interactivity         | ≤ **200 milliseconds**      |
| **CLS** (Cumulative Layout Shift) | Visual stability       | ≤ **0.1**                   |

INP became a stable Core Web Vital in 2024, replacing FID
([web-vitals][webvitals]). The canonical measurement standard is
**the 75th percentile** of page loads, segmented across mobile and
desktop ([web-vitals][webvitals]).

[lhci]: https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci

This skill covers **Lighthouse CI** (`@lhci/cli`) - the official
Google Chrome team tool for running Lighthouse on every PR and
asserting against budgets ([lhci][lhci]).

## When to use

- The project ships a web frontend (Next.js, Vite, Remix, plain
  static, etc.).
- The team has documented Web Vitals NFRs (per
  [`nfr-extractor`](../../../qa-shift-left/skills/nfr-extractor/SKILL.md))
  and needs CI enforcement.
- A PR's perf delta vs. main needs to be visible (regression-block
  or just-warn).
- The team uses Lighthouse for accessibility / SEO / best-practices
  audits beyond perf.

If the project is a backend API or a CLI tool, this skill doesn't
apply - use [`k6-load-testing`](../k6-load-testing/SKILL.md) or a
sibling load runner for backend perf.

## Install

```bash
npm install --save-dev @lhci/cli
```

(Per [lhci][lhci]; the docs reference `@lhci/cli@0.15.x` as the
current major.) Pin to a specific minor in CI for determinism.

## Configure

Create `.lighthouserc.js` (or `.lighthouserc.json`) at the project
root. The canonical shape per [lhci][lhci]:

```js
module.exports = {
  ci: {
    collect: {
      // What to audit
      url: [
        'http://localhost:3000/',
        'http://localhost:3000/dashboard',
        'http://localhost:3000/pricing',
      ],
      // How many runs per URL — median report wins; 3 is canonical for stability
      numberOfRuns: 3,
      // Lighthouse settings
      settings: {
        preset: 'desktop',                       // or 'mobile' (default)
        chromeFlags: '--no-sandbox',              // CI-runner-friendly
      },
      // Use a static-server when running headless in CI
      startServerCommand: 'npm run start',
      startServerReadyPattern: 'ready on',
    },
    assert: {
      // Canonical Web Vitals budgets per web.dev/articles/vitals
      assertions: {
        'largest-contentful-paint': ['error', { maxNumericValue: 2500 }],   // 2.5s
        'interaction-to-next-paint': ['error', { maxNumericValue: 200 }],   // 200ms
        'cumulative-layout-shift':   ['error', { maxNumericValue: 0.1 }],    // 0.1
        // Lighthouse category scores (0-1)
        'categories:performance':    ['warn',  { minScore: 0.9 }],
        'categories:accessibility':  ['error', { minScore: 0.95 }],
        'categories:best-practices': ['warn',  { minScore: 0.9 }],
      },
    },
    upload: {
      // Where to upload the .json reports for trend analysis
      target: 'temporary-public-storage',   // or 'lhci' for self-hosted server
    },
  },
};
```

Assertion levels per [lhci][lhci]:

- `'error'` - fails the CI run (exits non-zero).
- `'warn'` - surfaces in the report but doesn't fail.
- `'off'` - disabled (useful for opt-out per-page).

## Running

The canonical invocation per [lhci][lhci]:

```bash
lhci autorun
```

`autorun` runs three phases in sequence:

1. **collect** - start the server (if `startServerCommand` set), run
   Lighthouse N times per URL.
2. **assert** - compare results against the assertion config; exit
   non-zero on `error`-level failures.
3. **upload** - upload reports to the configured target for trend
   tracking.

For finer control, the phases can run independently: `lhci collect`,
`lhci assert`, `lhci upload`.

### Running specific URLs

For a single PR-relevant audit:

```bash
lhci collect --url=http://localhost:3000/dashboard --numberOfRuns=3
lhci assert
```

## CI integration

```yaml
# .github/workflows/lighthouse.yml
name: lighthouse

on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - 'src/**'
      - 'package.json'
      - 'package-lock.json'

jobs:
  lighthouse:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v5

      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'

      - run: npm ci

      - name: Build
        run: npm run build

      - name: Lighthouse CI
        env:
          LHCI_GITHUB_APP_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.LHCI_GITHUB_APP_TOKEN }}   # optional, for PR comments
        run: npx lhci autorun

      - name: Upload Lighthouse reports
        if: always()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: lighthouse-reports
          path: .lighthouseci/
          retention-days: 14
```

The optional `LHCI_GITHUB_APP_TOKEN` (set up via the Lighthouse CI
GitHub App) enables PR comments showing the per-metric delta vs. the
main branch's last green run.

## Mobile vs desktop budgets

LCP / INP thresholds are the same across mobile and desktop, but
**mobile is consistently slower** in practice - the same JS bundle
runs on a less-powerful CPU over a less-stable network.

Common pattern: separate `.lighthouserc.mobile.js` and
`.lighthouserc.desktop.js`, run both in CI. The mobile run uses
`preset: 'mobile'` (default) which applies CPU + network throttling
to simulate a mid-range Android device.

```bash
# Run both
LHCI_BUILD_CONTEXT__GITHUB_BASE_URL=https://github.com/... \
  npx lhci autorun --config=.lighthouserc.mobile.js
npx lhci autorun --config=.lighthouserc.desktop.js
```

## Anti-patterns

| Anti-pattern                                                  | Why it fails                                                       | Fix |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-----|
| `numberOfRuns: 1`                                              | Single-run measurements are noisy; flaky alerts.                  | Use 3 (canonical) or 5 for high-stakes pages; LHCI uses the median. |
| Asserting on `first-input-delay` (FID)                          | FID was retired in 2024 ([web-vitals][webvitals]).                 | Use `interaction-to-next-paint` (INP). |
| Hard error on every metric out of the box                       | Existing pages may not meet thresholds; team learns to ignore the gate. | Start with `warn` for everything; promote to `error` once green for 2 weeks. |
| Auditing only the homepage                                     | The homepage is usually the most-optimized page; misses regressions on long-tail routes. | Audit a representative URL set: home + 1 logged-in dashboard + 1 long-form content + 1 form-heavy. |
| Lighthouse score as the sole metric                             | Lighthouse score conflates multiple subscores; doesn't isolate which Web Vital regressed. | Assert on the individual Web Vitals (`largest-contentful-paint`, `interaction-to-next-paint`, `cumulative-layout-shift`); category score is supplementary. |
| Running against production                                       | Lighthouse fires real network requests and triggers analytics; pollutes prod metrics. | Always against staging or a local build. |

## Lab vs field

Lighthouse CI measures **lab data** (synthetic; deterministic
runner). Field data (real-user metrics, RUM) is measured by Web Vitals
JS in production. Both matter:

| Source         | Tool                                | Use for                                |
|----------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Lab (synthetic)| Lighthouse CI                        | Per-PR regression gate.                 |
| Field (RUM)    | `web-vitals` library + analytics     | Real-user 75th-percentile tracking.    |

Lighthouse CI catches per-PR regressions; field data tracks the
75th-percentile threshold per [web-vitals][webvitals]. Don't substitute
one for the other.
